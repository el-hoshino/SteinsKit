## Tiny yet Easy-to-use Observer-Pattern implementation in Swift 

SteinsKit is a framework to help you implement *Observer Pattern* without any FRP concepts.

Please note that this framework hasn't been widely tested yet, and currently it's for iOS only.

Please open an issue or send me a pull request if you have any problems, better ideas or any other things you want me to know.

## Why SteinsKit

If you're a big fan of FRP, or you want to deeply dive into the world of Reactive Programming, probably libraries like RxSwift or ReactiveSwift would be a better choice for you.

However, if what you want is just a quick implement of Observer Pattern, and you don't want to care about the concepts in FRP like *Streams* or *Hot/Cold Observables*, you may want to try SteinsKit!

With SteinsKit, you don't have to care about what a stream is, or if the observable is hot or cold. The concept is very simple: you give the variable a new value, and all objects observing the variable receive the new value. That's it!

## Requirements

- iOS 11.0+
- Xcode 10.2+
- Swift 5.0+

## Installation

### Use Carthage

- Download and install [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage#installing-carthage).
- Add the following line to your [Cartfile](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage/blob/master/Documentation/Artifacts.md#cartfile):

```txt
github "el-hoshino/SteinsKit"
```

- Run `carthage update`.
- Add the framework to your project.

### Manually

- Download the whole repository.
- Add the NotAutoLayout project file into your project.
- Build the framework.

## Usage

### TL;DR

You can check a demo code in Playground. It looks like this:

![screenshot](README_Resource/PlaygroundSample.png)

But anyway, the core code that this framework does (and is aimed to) is like this:

```swift
model.count
    .map({ "Welcome!\nWe have \($0) visitors visited\nour playground!" })
    .beObserved(by: label, .asyncOnQueue(.main), onChanged: { $0.text = $1 })
```

### Tell me more

SteinsKit uses `Variable` and `LazyVariable` classes to store the value, the closures to handle when value changes, and the weak references of the observers. So the approach is very simple:

1. Declare a `Variable` or a `LazyVariable`, and expose it as `AnyObservable`. Please note that if you declare a `Variable`, you have to give it an initial value, which you don't have to if you declare a `LazyVariable`.
2. Subscribe the `AnyObservable` through `beObserved(by:, onChanged:)` method. If needed, you can also insert `map(_:)` methods before subscribing it. And as you subscribing the `AnyObservable`, the latest value (if available) will be immediately reflected in your `onChanged` handler.
3. Put new values to the `Variable` or `LazyVariable` through `accept(_:)` method from the object that holds it, and all objects subscribe it receive the new value immediately.

You may notice that in the sample above, there is no `[weak object]` capture list, or subscription disposing declarations like `.disposed(by: disposeBag)` which you may be familiar with if you use RxSwift. This is because:

1. The object passed to `by:` parameter in `beObserved` method will be weakly referred in `Variable`. This makes the object acts like a `DisposeBag` in RxSwift, that when the object is released from memory, the subscription will also be released from the `Variable`.
2. The object passed to `by:` parameter in `beObserved` method will also be sent to `onChanged` handler closure as the first input parameter `$0`, and is already weakly captured inside the `beObserved` method. So you don't have to declare it in the capture list manually in your code, and in addition you can directly use it in your closure with `$1` as the latest value.

In addition, you can also choose which queue to use for the observation. The settings are:

- `.async(DispatchQueue)`: The `onChanged` handler will run after the value changed, on the queue passed, using `DispatchQueue.async`. Handy for UI components as the subscriber to redraw with latest values on main thread.
- .`sync(DispatchQueue)`: The `onChanged` handler will run after the value changed, on the queue passed, using `DispatchQueue.sunc`. Always remember that this may cause a deadlock if you don't use the threads properly.
- `.directly`: The `onChanged` handler will run immediatly after the value changed, just on the queue which changed the value.

And if you choose not to pass the queue parameter, `.directly` will be used.

All the design described above makes it much more simple to write an Observer Pattern code.

- [ ] No enough tests yet, especially about the ARC.
